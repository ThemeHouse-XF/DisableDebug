# DisableDebug

DisableDebug allows the average developer to easily enable and disable debug mode in certain parts of XenForo. 

Debug mode must first be enabled either through options or through your library/config.php file. Once done, debug mode can be be restricted to admin only, public only, disable debug everywhere, or simply enable debug everywhere.

Debug mode can also be IP restricted through options, making it easier for the developer on the go.
